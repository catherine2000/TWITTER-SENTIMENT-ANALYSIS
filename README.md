# TWITTER-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS

This repository contains the code for sentiment analysis of tweets from Twitter related to Expo 2020 in UAE. This was an academic group project.

The dataset is created by extracting tweets and their metadata (number of likes, date and time of posting, etc) from Twitter using a Python library, Tweepy.

Using text analytics techniques, the data is analysed for insights on the sentiments of tweets and the main topics discussed by users online. A categorization system is also developed to automatically assign sentiments to unlabeled tweets.

The following steps were performed:

1. Data Collection
2. Data Labelling
3. Text Analytics Pipeline on Tweets (Text processing, representation, classification and evaluation)
4. Visualization and Insights from Tweets
